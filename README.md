**Department of Environmental Studies, New York University, New York, NY** (June 2020 – May 2021)\
Data Science Research Assistant (project funded by NSF grant)
- Harmonized and combined gameplay and participant survey data from 7 different behavioral studies conducted on-site with farmers in 7 countries as coordination games where coordinated, environment-friendly decisions lead to higher scores– incentivized by actual money.
- Quantified environmental, agricultural and cooperation outcomes from the experiments; verified validity of the experiments by discovering correlations between the in-game and actual beliefs of participants.
- Analyzed how subsidies effect farmers' prioritization of adopting environment and wildlife conservation practices in agriculture as a way of studying effect of PES (Payments for Ecosystem Services) at low cost.
- Uncovered that high variation in demographic factors as well as prominence of certain beliefs (towards community, future generations, environment, government, and punishments) within a group contribute to increased net productivity and better environmental practices, using regression analysis and ANOVA.
- Identified dynamic process of human learning in terms of changes in game choices and game performance as the games progressed using time-series analysis.

- Provided one on one mentoring for assignments, laboratory work and projects.

*Graduate Researcher* (June 2020 – September 2020)
- Studied neural network architecture and pruning techniques (creating smaller neural nets from bigger ones) to create smaller, and possibly faster-learning networks.
- Explored SNIP-technique for more efficient one-shot learning and creation of masks for multi-task learning.
- Evaluation on LeNet using MNIST dataset and its variants.

- Worked individually on statistical analysis of single-channel static convolutional neural network models for text categorization using tensorflow.

## PROJECTS

- **Semantic Cognition in Dense Convolutional Networks-** Explored the similarity between CNN-based architectures and human biological neural systems by simulating and studying the pattern of learning (differentiating) and forgetting (dementia) with object recognition on CIFAR-100 as the cognitive task and DenseNet-BC as the model. Explored category typicality and effect of distortion using class ranking correlations.
- **Optimal Representative Training Subset Selection-** Converted text documents to low-dimensional representations and used statistical distance and sparse coding based-methods for selecting the most representative subsets, beating the active learning and topic model-based D-optimal design selection methods from literature.
- **Gender Reinflection in Machine Translation-** Created a novel user-aware gender reinflection translation model that both translates and reinflects the gender as specified; also built two gender parallel corpora (English-French and English-Spanish) for training and evaluation of the MLE and sequence-to-sequence models.
- **Smart e-commerce-** Performed time-series forecasting for online retail sales, temporal customer segmentation for targeted marketing, customer network analysis, market-basket analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Yelp Fake Review Detection-** Implemented gradient boosting and deep neural networks for detection of fake restaurant reviews with high degree of separability; identified and analyzed features that led to flagging.
- **Goodreads Book Recommender System-** Implemented collaborative-filtering-based recommender system in pySpark using user interactions; visualized book clusters to understand recommendation relevance.
- **Nutritional labelling of Home Credit Default Risk Automated Decision System-** Analysis of the performance, fairness, stability, interpretability and practicality of credit risk-assigning ADS (automated decision system) trained on Home Credit dataset from Kaggle.
- **San Francisco’s Opioid Crisis and Effects on Public Safety-** Identification of potential regions for installation of Safe Injection Sites; analysis of crime trends across regions; predictions of crime using spatial and temporal features using random forest and xgboost.
- **Flight Arrival Delay Prediction-** Performed exploratory analysis of the various origin airports, destination airports, carriers, distances and time periods for ascertaining delay factors; estimated delay time using time-series forecasting.
- **Psychometric Analysis Tool-**: Built a tool for interviewers and/or psychologists that powers judgment by determining the interviewee’s psychological characteristics based on the detection and analysis of factors such as facial expressions, speech emotions, the polarity of written opinion or sentiment analysis (by employing CNN and sequential models) and question answering through chat-bot interview.
- **Fuzzy Image Processing Tool-** Built an image processing tool that uses Java’s jFuzzyLogic library and Fuzzy Control Language (FCL). Functionalities implemented using fuzzy logic include grayscale-image contrast enhancement, colour-image contrast enhancement, edge detection and image segmentation.
