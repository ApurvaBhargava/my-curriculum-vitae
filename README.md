## EXPERIENCE
**International Flavors & Fragrances, New York, NY** (June 2021 – Present)\
*Data Science Intern*
- Time-series forecasting quantity and unit prices for all vendors and subsidiaries.
- Large scale acquisition, cleaning, and integration of logistics and operations data from multiple databases; automating the discovery process of data availability; harmonizing and interpreting the data at different granularity levels.
- Using statistical modeling/ machine learning for optimizing logistics and operations- predicting the busiest routes, frequencies, opportunities to consolidate shipments, opportunities to change mode from air to ocean, etc.
- Building dashboards using Business Intelligence tools for interactive visualizations.
- Presenting the models to stakeholders for approval. Setting up a baseline as well as a process to measure future improvements.

**Department of Environmental Studies, New York University, New York, NY** (June 2020 – May 2021)\
Data Science Research Assistant (project funded by NSF grant)
- Harmonized and combined gameplay and participant survey data from 7 different behavioral studies conducted on-site with farmers in 7 countries as coordination games where coordinated, environment-friendly decisions lead to higher scores– incentivized by actual money.
- Quantified environmental, agricultural and cooperation outcomes from the experiments; verified validity of the experiments by discovering correlations between the in-game and actual beliefs of participants.
- Analyzed how subsidies effect farmers' prioritization of adopting environment and wildlife conservation practices in agriculture as a way of studying effect of PES (Payments for Ecosystem Services) at low cost.
- Uncovered that high variation in demographic factors as well as prominence of certain beliefs (towards community, future generations, environment, government, and punishments) within a group contribute to increased net productivity and better environmental practices, using regression analysis and ANOVA.
- Identified dynamic process of human learning in terms of changes in game choices and game performance as the games progressed using time-series analysis.

**Courant’s Center for Data Science, New York University, New York, NY**\
*Adjunct Instructor* (May 2021 – July 2021)
- Co-instructed and graded for the Data Science for Everyone course, which is the flagship course of the NYU Center for Data Science, and the first course in the sequences for both the data science major and minor.
- Contributed to creating course material (videos and jupyter notebooks) for applied machine learning using Python.

*Graduate Teaching Assistant* (January 2021 – May 2021)
- Taught laboratory section (bias in machine learning systems, data profiling, data scrubbing, privacy-preserving data synthesis, machine learning model interpretability) using Python for ‘Responsible Data Science’ course.
- Actively contributed to creating course material and testing AI fairness and ML model interpretation frameworks (IBM aif360, fairlearn, mlinspect, SHAP, LIME).
- Provided one on one mentoring for assignments, laboratory work and projects.

*Graduate Teaching Assistant* (September 2020 – December, 2020)
- Taught laboratory and implementation (numpy, pandas, sklearn, sampling, significance tests, bias/variance, regularization, logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, neural networks, bagging, gradient boosting, spam detection, image classification) using Python for Introduction to Data Science course.
- Provided one on one mentoring for assignments, laboratory work and projects.

*Graduate Researcher* (June 2020 – September 2020)
- Studied neural network architecture and pruning techniques (creating smaller neural nets from bigger ones) to create smaller, and possibly faster-learning networks.
- Explored SNIP-technique for more efficient one-shot learning and creation of masks for multi-task learning.
- Evaluation on LeNet using MNIST dataset and its variants.

*Summer Research Intern* (May 2018 – July 2018)
- Assisted with data pre-processing, model evaluation, research paper summarization for ongoing PhD-scholar research work (Visual Question Answering and Topic Modeling for Clustering news).
- Worked individually on statistical analysis of single-channel static convolutional neural network models for text categorization using tensorflow.

## PROJECTS

Optimal Representative Training Subset Selection- Converted text documents to low-dimensional representations and used statistical distance and sparse coding based-methods for selecting the most representative subsets, beating the active learning and topic model-based D-optimal design selection methods from literature.
Gender Reinflection in Machine Translation - Created a novel user-aware gender reinflection translation model that
both translates and reinflects the gender as specified; also built two gender parallel corpora (English-French and English-
Spanish) for training and evaluation of the MLE and sequence-to-sequence models.
E-commerce: Time series forecasting of online retail sales, and temporal customer segmentation for targeted marketing.
Semantic Cognition in Dense Convolutional Networks: Simulated and studied the pattern of learning (differentiating)
and forgetting (dementia) with object recognition on CIFAR-100 as the cognitive task and DenseNet-BC as the model.
Goodreads Book Recommender System- Implemented collaborative-filtering-based recommender system in pySpark
using user interactions; visualized book clusters to understand recommendation relevance.
