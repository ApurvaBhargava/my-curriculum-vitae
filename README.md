## EXPERIENCE
**International Flavors & Fragrances, New York, NY** (June 2021 – Present)\
*Data Science Intern*
- Time-series forecasting quantity and unit prices for all vendors and subsidiaries.
- Large scale acquisition, cleaning, and integration of logistics and operations data from multiple databases.
- Using statistical modeling/ machine learning for optimizing logistics and operations- predicting the busiest routes, opportunities to consolidate shipments, opportunities to change mode from air to ocean, etc.
- Building dashboards using Business Intelligence tools for interactive visualizations.

**Department of Environmental Studies, New York University, New York, NY** (June 2020 – May 2021)\
Data Science Research Assistant (project funded by NSF grant)
- Harmonized and combined gameplay and participant survey data from 7 different behavioral studies conducted on-site with farmers in 7 countries as coordination games where coordinated, environment-friendly decisions lead to higher scores– incentivized by actual money.
- Analyzed how subsidies effect farmers' prioritization of adopting environment and wildlife conservation practices in agriculture as a way of studying effect of PES (Payments for Ecosystem Services) at low cost.
- Uncovered that high variation in demographic factors as well as prominence of certain beliefs contribute to increased net productivity and better environmental practices, using regression analysis and ANOVA.
- Identified dynamic process of human learning in terms of changes in game choices and game performance as the games progressed using time-series analysis.

**Courant’s Center for Data Science, New York University, New York, NY**\
*Adjunct Instructor | Graduate Teaching Assistant* (September 2020 – July 2021)
- Co-instructed the ‘Data Science for Everyone’ course, the flagship course of the Center for Data Science; taught programming sections using Python for ‘Responsible Data Science’ and ‘Introduction to Data Science’ courses. Provided one on one mentoring for assignments, laboratory work and projects. • Created course material using popular data science and ML libraries, AI fairness frameworks, SHAP, etc.
*Graduate Researcher* (June 2020 – September 2020)
- Studied neural network architecture and pruning; explored SNIP-technique for pruning convolutional neural networks for more efficient one-shot learning and mask-based multi-task learning using image datasets.
