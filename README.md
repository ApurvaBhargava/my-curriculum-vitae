## ABOUT ME

Machine Learning/ AI Engineer with 4 years of professional and academic experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems, Master of Science in Data Science from New York University and Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, India.

I am passionate about translating intelligence from carbon brains to silicon ones and decoding the complexities of learning processes. With a strong background in AI and a deep curiosity for how intelligence emerges and evolves, I am eager to be a part of immersive research in artificial general intelligence.

My research interest is in applying constructs from deep learning, neuroscience, linguistics and computational cognitive modeling to natural language understanding and generation. I am driven by the challenge of teaching machines to reason about ambiguity and logic in language, something that even the human brain struggles with at times.

I believe in the plasticity of mind and welcome new ideas and perspectives. Since the mind is bigger than the person, I also write poetry and short stories.
